# MoleculeDM (WIP)
An extremely simple Linux display manager written in python. (CURRENTLY WIP)

## What is the purpose of this?
This is meant to be a simple project for me to teach myself more python and learn a bit more about Linux. Its probably a lot more impractical compared to most other Display Managers, but I've a need to be able to configure what desktop environments my display manager uses in an easy to understand method, as well as an easier way to launch into Shell or an xinitrc file. Despite this being designed mainly for myself, I'd love for others to try it out once it's finished, and make it usable for others.
